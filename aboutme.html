        In the big world of computers and the internet, my adventure began with a simple curiosity and a click of a mouse. <br> As I journeyed through the digital realm, I discovered the power of coding and the art of creating websites.

        My first <br> steps into coding came with the ALX Software Engineer Scholarship, an online program where I learned the basics of <br> programming using a language called C. For three weeks, I dived deep into the world of <br> code, learning how to write commands and make computers do amazing things.

        Eager to explore more, I joined the Orange <br> Digital Center coding school. Here, I learned how to make fun games using JavaScript and Kaboom. <br> It was like being a wizard, using spells (code) to create magical worlds on the screen.

        But my journey didn't stop there. <br> I wanted to learn about both coding and how to promote things online. <br> So, I enrolled in Max Business School's digital marketing program. While studying digital marketing, I decided <br> to put my coding skills to use and built my first WordPress website, saahjamesthesavvy.com.

       <br> Creating saahjamesthesavvy.com was like painting a picture with code. I learned how to design web pages, add <br> pictures, and make everything look just right. It was exciting to see my ideas come to life on the screen.

        As I continued my studies,<br>  I learned more about WordPress and how to make websites that people would love to visit. <br> Even though saahjamesthesavvy.com is no longer online, it will always be a special part of my journey, <br>a symbol of how far I've come and how much I've learned.

        Now, as I look ahead, I'm filled with excitement for what's next. <br> Armed with my newfound skills and experiences, I'm ready to tackle new challenges and create even more amazing things in the world <br> of coding and creating. The adventure continues, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next. <br>
