        At ZIT, my first project called "Our Proud" celebrates the national anthem. <br>
        Using only HTML, we created a simple yet impactful experience. <br> 
        The project includes audio of the anthem and images that evoke patriotism. <br>
        It's a tribute to our nation's pride and unity, showcasing the power of <br>
        simplicity in digital storytelling. With "Our Proud," we aim to inspire <br>
        a sense of belonging and appreciation for our heritage.

    <p>
        For my recent project, I made a Premium League table using HTML and CSS. <br>
        It shows stats for ten top teams, like their rank, matches played, wins, draws, <br>
        and goals against. At the top, you'll see the Premium League logo. It's easy to <br>
        use and helps fans see how well their favorite teams are doing in the league. With <br>
        clean formatting and clear organization, this table provides a straightforward <br>
        way for fans to stay updated on the latest standings and performances. Whether <br>
        you're a die-hard supporter or just curious about the league, this project offers <br>
        a user-friendly platform to engage with the exciting world of football.

    <p>
       At the Orange Digital Center, my team and I embarked on an exhilarating project to <br>
        create a captivating 2D running game using JavaScript and Node.js. Drawing inspiration <br>
         from classic platformers, we combined our creativity and technical expertise to develop <br>
          a dynamic gaming experience that would delight players of all ages.

        Our game featured vibrant <br> graphics, smooth animations, and immersive sound effects, transporting players 
        to a thrilling world filled with <br> obstacles and challenges. Leveraging the power of Node.js,
         we implemented real-time <br>
         multiplayer functionality, allowing users to compete against friends or team <br>up for cooperative gameplay.

        Throughout the development process, we collaborated closely,<br> brainstorming ideas, refining mechanics, and overcoming obstacles together. With each line of code and iteration, we pushed the <br>
         boundaries of what was possible, striving to deliver a polished and engaging gaming experience. <br>

        In the end, our hard work paid off as we unveiled our creation to the world. <br> From the adrenaline-pumping gameplay to the seamless multiplayer integration, our 2D running <br>
         game captivated players and showcased the immense potential of JavaScript <br>and Node.js in game development. It was a testament to the power of teamwork, creativity, and <br>
         innovation, and a project that we were proud to have accomplished at the Orange Digital Center.
